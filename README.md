# Programming environment
We'll use Visual Studio Code. You will need to install the extension for Jupyter Notebooks.
You can also use the PyDroid3 app on your cellphone.

# Presentation topics
Each presentation is performed by groups of 3 students. In a presentation a programming concept or tool is introduced, together with code and examples to showcase the use of the tool. Students must be able to explain and showcase the usage of the programming tool and answer the questions that arise.

# Project
Course project involves scraping cryptocurrency prices from a website, storing them in a CSV file and then using a time series forecasting model to predict future prices. Students will work in groups of 2 and will receive hints on how to parse HTML data and on using the time series model. 

Students will be required to defend their project.
